Introduction
####
Mote is a framework for building your own `pattern library or design system`_ using Django and Python.

Features
====
* Unopinionated - follow `Atomic Design`_ if you wish, or come up with your own methodology. Use Bootstrap or Foundation, or your own CSS framework.
* Convention over configuration - getting a pattern library up and running is quick and easy.
* Leverages Django template inheritance and layering.
* Trawls the file system, so no databases or complicated integrations, and all of your code and documentation exists in version control.
* The Mote Explorer: A self-assembling interface which surfaces all of your patterns and their documentation.
* Allows multiple projects, with multiple pattern libraries.
* Install and extend other pattern libraries.
* Create a `living style guide`_ for Django projects, or use it to create documentation for framework-agnostic UI patterns, or both.
